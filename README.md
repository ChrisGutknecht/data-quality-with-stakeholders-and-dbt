## Live poll


Ysession on "Collaborating on Data Quality in an E-commerce Company," you can creatively utilize the "No Slides" format by incorporating a range of dynamic, interactive content and tools that will actively engage your audience. Here are different methods to show content in a session slot for your topic:

1. GitHub Repository for Code Collaboration
Method: Begin the session by sharing a GitHub repository URL containing code examples for data quality checks, scripts, and workflows. Use GitHub's README files to provide context and explanations.
Interactive Element: Encourage participants to fork the repo, explore the code, and suggest improvements or modifications in real-time using GitHub Issues or Pull Requests. You can also showcase live collaboration through code pair programming with volunteers from the audience.
2. Live Example of Team Discussions
Method: Simulate or reenact real-life scenarios where different teams (such as Data Analysts, Engineers, Product Managers, etc.) discuss data quality issues.
Interactive Element: Use a tool like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord to demonstrate how teams handle data quality alerts. Consider inviting participants to join a live chat channel during the session to replicate a discussion environment or use a role-playing method to engage volunteers from the audience.
3. DBT Test Configurations in dbt Explore
Method: Share your screen and navigate through dbt Cloud or dbt Core to showcase different test configurations. Use dbt Explore to demonstrate how to set up and customize data tests to suit specific e-commerce data quality needs.
Interactive Element: Perform a live walkthrough of configuring data quality tests, followed by executing them and analyzing the results. Ask the audience to suggest tests based on real-world scenarios, then configure and run them on the spot to illustrate the process.
4. Looker Studio Dashboards for Data Visualization
Method: Open Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) to display dashboards that visualize data quality metrics and monitored data. Showcase how you use these dashboards to identify trends, outliers, or data quality issues.
Interactive Element: Walk the audience through the creation of a dashboard from scratch or make modifications to an existing dashboard based on audience suggestions. Demonstrate how to set up alerts or scheduled reports to monitor data quality continuously.
5. Live Q&A and Problem-Solving
Method: Incorporate Q&A segments throughout your session to address questions as they arise, rather than waiting until the end. Encourage the audience to pose challenges or specific scenarios related to data quality.
Interactive Element: Solve these problems live, using your tools (GitHub, dbt, Looker Studio) to demonstrate practical solutions in real-time.
6. Interactive Polls and Surveys
Method: Use tools like Mentimeter, Slido, or Google Forms to conduct live polls or surveys. For example, ask the audience about their current data quality practices or challenges they face.
Interactive Element: Display results in real-time, and adapt your session content based on audience responses to make the discussion more relevant and engaging.
7. Use Real-Time Data Feeds
Method: Show a live data feed that reflects actual changes or issues in data quality. This could be done by connecting to a database or data warehouse that updates frequently.
Interactive Element: Challenge the audience to identify and diagnose data quality issues based on the live feed. Walk through the steps needed to address these issues using the tools at your disposal.
8. Interactive Workflow Diagrams and Whiteboarding
Method: Use an online whiteboarding tool like Miro or Mural to map out data quality workflows, processes, or data lineage diagrams collaboratively.
Interactive Element: Invite the audience to contribute to the whiteboard, adding their own ideas, solutions, or feedback in real-time.
9. Demonstrate Alerts Setup and Notification Management
Method: Showcase how to set up data quality alerts using tools like Slack, PagerDuty, or email notifications that trigger based on dbt test failures.
Interactive Element: Set up a live alert system and simulate a dbt test failure to show how alerts propagate and how teams should respond. You could even prompt the audience to send test alerts to their own devices.
10. Run a Mini-Workshop
Method: Dedicate a portion of the session to hands-on exercises. Provide datasets and ask participants to run their data quality checks or set up a test using the provided tools.
Interactive Element: Offer guidance, answer questions, and provide immediate feedback. This encourages active participation and deepens understanding.
By leveraging these methods, you can create a highly engaging, interactive session that aligns with the "No Slides" philosophy of the conference while providing valuable insights and practical skills to your audience.
